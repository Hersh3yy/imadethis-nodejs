This is the backend for 'imadethis' which is a recipe logging application. The frontend is a vue.js application.

This app will be used to learn the Google Cloud Platform and will eventually be hosted there.

App users can log their entrees. An entree is their attempt at making a recipe. They can add their own personal note and an image of the result.
